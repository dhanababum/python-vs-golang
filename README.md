# Repo main moto
I know it's difficult to learn a new language(golang) especially if you come from a dynamic typed language(Python). This repository can teach you understand the difference between python vs golang.

**Note: This repo main aim is to teach you the differrence between Python vs Golang. However, it won't judge of thier need**

# language versions
* Python: 3.8
* go: 1.15

# Language Definition
## Python
* Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages. 
* Python is an opensource, interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
* Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.
* Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
## Go
* Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
* Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.
* Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

# Language Syntax
## Python
* Python is meant to be an easily readable language.
* Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.
### Example
```
for i in range(10):
    print(f"number {i}")
```
